SkeeDuino is an Arduino-based control system for a Skee Ball machine. The scoring mechanism is scalable, so it could be used for other games and systems. 

## Origin
SkeeDuino is (or was) my first Arduino project and it gave me a path to absorb the Arduino development process. My employer hosted a festival in October 2016 and we planned for a lot of activities for the local kids and their families. When someone on the team mentioned a Skee Ball machine, I knew I had found the perfect project to use as "course curriculum" for Arduino. 

There was a tremendous amount of trial, error, sweat, and swearing involved in the making of this project. I hope to continue to improve on the project as time permits. 

## Roadmap
Currently, the repository consists of just the base code and a pinout. Going forward I have plans to provide additional documentation, including a hardware list, wiring instructions, and a list of individual discoveries made along the way (don't do this, definitely do that).
